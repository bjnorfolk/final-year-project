\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Here we present a shock structure tracking technique and detailed discussion on the fluid dynamics of transient supersonic jets. We explore the fundamental fluid dynamics of transient supersonic jets with variation of the exit flow nozzle geometry and plate impingement. Our nozzle geometries include a convergent, divergent, and convergent-divergent design. The impingement of transient supersonic jets has previously been studied, however it is absent of extensive data, high quality schlieren, and variable exit geometry. We aim to address absences in the literature, explore in detail the shock-vortex interaction during jet impingement, and track the progression of the shock structure with a novel algorithm. Our discussion of the fundamental fluid dynamics governing the transient supersonic jet process details the affects of alternating the incident Mach number for, nozzle geometry variation on the shock-vortex interaction and jet plate impingement.

Gas turbine engines are an integral component for the function of ground based power generation and aircraft engines. They account for a large percentage of power generation world wide. Thermodynamic cycle advances in gas turbine design play an important role in preventing the growth of emissions pollution and prolonged global warming \cite{paxson2018pressure}. Pressure gain combustion (PGC) is one possible to method of efficiency improvement. PGC is a constant volume combustion process that operates by increasing the stagnation pressure entering the turbine via heat released from combustion. Increasing the turbine inlet pressure allows for considerably more work to be extracted when the turbine expands the flow back to the free stream pressure. PGC optimises gas turbine thermodynamic cycle efficiency, and has the potential to increase current engine efficiency up to 10\% \cite{gulen2013constant}.

PGC is at peak efficiency when accomplished through detonation driven combustion, this involves the implementation of detonation waves within the combuster to cause an increase in the temperature and pressure of the fuel-air mixture \cite{eidelman1991review}. During combustion, detonation waves produce flow at supersonic velocities leading to an approximate constant volume and significant pressure gain across the combustor. For supersonic velocities high pressure turbine inlet flow must be steady. A possible method to achieve steady flow at the turbine inlet is via the implementation of a pulse detonation engine \cite{kailasanath2009research} with an equalising plenum chamber. Wear on the first stage of the turbine presents itself as one of the most significant problems of PGC implemetation in current engines. Replacing the combustor in a conventional gas turbine with a pulse detonation combustor (PDC) will result in the propergating detonation waves to converge on the first stage of the turbine. This overtime can lead to concentrated wear on the first stage of the turbine high wear stress points \cite{dean2005operation}. To alleviate turbine wear, the utilization of a high pressure plenum chamber is placed at the exit of the PDC, and creates steady flow conditions effectively shielding the first stage of the turbine from combustion detonations. It remains unclear on how to integrate a pressure plenum into a PDC design. 

The fluid dynamics characterising the governing flow at the exit of PDC is defined as a shock-driven, transient, supersonic jet process \cite{radulescu2007transient}. The governing flow can be classified into several different stages \cite{ishii1999experimental} as shown in Figure \ref{fig:0}. The first stage of jet evolution is defined by the diffraction of a shock wave around the corners of the tube exit, this region is bounded by the curved part of the incident shock, the nozzle lip, and a reflected sound wave.

%\centering
%\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{fig0.PNG}
%\caption{Features of the diffraction pattern \cite{skews1967}}
%\label{fig:0}
%\end{figure}
In the next stage of jet evolution, a vortex ring is generated by the roll-up of the shear layer due to Kelvin-Helmholtz type instabilities along the slipstream at the nozzle lip \cite{elder1952experimental,dora2014role}. Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities exist within the shock as a result of external perturbations (inhomogeneities in the flow) producing oscillations in the vortex sheet separating fluids with different flow characteristics. This structure propagates down the jet axis, and is simultaneously accompanied by the translation of a curved barrel shock formed initially at the nozzle lip. This instigates the formation of a curved Mach disk for a ratio of the nozzle exit to free-stream pressure exceeding $2.06$ \cite{matsuda1987numerical}. MORE ON MACH DISK

A triple point occurs between the leading edge of the barrel shock, the second shock, and the Mach disk. Given a sufficiently strong jet, a slip surface is generated downstream of the triple point. The first shock cell is formed in the third stage of jet evolution which is marked by the pinch-off phenomenon of the vortex ring, and signals the start of the trailing jet phase \cite{gharib1998universal}. Separation of the vortex ring from the flow structure is driven by Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities within the shear layer of the trailing jet \cite{zhao2000effects}. The final stage of the supersonic jet is defined by the point at which the transient jet and vortex are no longer joined and the trailing jet forms. This is accompanied by the formation of a quasi-steady shock cell in self-sustained oscillation, radiating strong pressure waves. %These four stages of jet evolution are illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:2}.

Investigation into the high pressure plenum chamber required for PDEs currently has not been undertaken. However, the flow dynamics is considered analogous to the impingement of a transient supersonic jet on a flat plate. The governing dynamics of transient jet impingment can be classified into serveral stages as The physical process is initially characterised by the reflection of the incident shock wave on the impinging plate. The reflected shock wave propargates back towards the nozzle and interacts with the approaching vortex ring. The central section of the reflected shock wave is captured by the embedded rearward-facing shock at the centre of the vortex ring, and is intensified by the opposing high-speed flow. Simultaneously, the outer section of the shock wave is diffracted by the vortex core. This process results in the formation of a toroidal shock wave which focuses in the trailing jet along the longitudinal axis of flow. The next stage of the fluid dynamics is defined by the impingement of the propagating vortex ring. Initially, as the vortex ring approaches the wall, its propagation velocity decreases and its diameter increases due to the adverse pressure gradient present \cite{szumowski2000starting}. After votex impingement the vortical flow undergoes rapid radial expansion developing a boundary layer on the surface, which slows down the flow and increases the pressure distribution over the plate. After a given duration that is dependent on the initial incident Mach number, the boundary layer separates from the plate and the flow rolls up generating a series of secondary vortices. This also occurs at the thin shear layer present between the jet flow and the exterior fluid as the region rolls up due to Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. This produces small interacting secondary vortex rings that propagate towards the plate \cite{minota1997shock}. Cumulative interactions between the primary and secondary wall vortex rings result in a near standing lift off of the pair. The secondary ring subsequently merges with the primary ring, and the weakened newly formed vortex ring continues to translate down the plate. %Stages of impingement are illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:4} below.

%	\label{fig:4}
%\end{figure}
%For a plate of variable angle, the lower core of the vortex ring impinges initially, and generates an asymmetric set of secondary vortices. These new flow structures orbit around the main vortex, creating a temporarily thicker boundary layer at the lower end of the flow field. Again after a period of time, dependent on the incident Mach number, he boundary layer separates from the plate. This results in the vortex ring pivoting on the lower core, undergoing negligible deformation, towards the surface plate. The upper core then impinges on the plate and the upper wall vortex is generated. This new structure begins to expand radially increasing in thickness due to the remaining jet flow. While simultaneously, the lower wall vortex propagates around the outer limits of the main vortex, stops expanding, and dissipates into a  thin structure. The impinging jet continues to feed into the upper section of the flow field, generating  wall vortices with a thicker upper core. For lower angles of plate alignment, the flow field shows an increase in overall velocity, and visible curvature of the vortex ring structure during impingement. The toroidal shock wave that forms as a result of impingement propagates perpendicularly with respect to the surface \cite{mariani2013}.  
%
%The far-field noise developed by the shock wave-vortex interaction can be decomposed into three components, the sound field due to the formation and evolution of the vortex ring, the reflection shock and vortex ring interaction noise production, and the noise due to impingement of the ring on the plate. The plate-votex ring impingement noise is produced by fluctuating pressure due to the deformation and stretching of the vortex ring, formation and growth of a secondary wall vortex ring, and lifting-off of the primary-secondary vortex ring pair \cite{murugan2010}.

\section{Experimental Methods}
\subsection{Shock Tube Facility}
The experiments presented were conducted in the LTRAC Supersonic Jet Facility. A schematic of the facility is shown in Figure \ref{shocktube}. 

The facility utilises compressed air delivered by the Monash University compressed air supply system. To produce a canonical transient supersonic jet a shock tube model is adopted \cite{john1962shock}. A typical shock tube consists of a high pressure section (driver section) and a low pressure section (driven section) separated by a diaphragm. Air enters the driver section until a desired pressure is reached, the diaphragm is then ruptured via a puncture from an actuated pin. Following the rupture, compression waves are fired down the driven section by the high pressure gas in the driver. As these compression waves travel down the tube they coalesce and form a shock wave that propagates into the test section, diffracts, and produces a transient supersonic jet. The shock tube model is fitted with a converging nozzle and impinging plate, shown in Figure \ref{attachment}. 

To prevent reflecting flow and acoustic feedback loop interference, the converging nozzle was designed with a $60^\circ$ exterior angle and a $0.5mm$ lip. During the evolution of a transient supersonic jet, the vortex is fully formed at approximately 3 inner diameters from the exit for a conventional, no nozzle, shock tube \cite{mariani2013head}. As a result, an impingement plate distance is chosen DISTANCE AND WHY. The plate diameter is designed to appear infinite to the flow.

The relationship between the driver (4) pressure ratio and the ambient (1) pressure of the system is shown in Equation \ref{shock}, and was utilised to calculate the design incident Mach number propagating from the shock tube \cite{anderson2010fundamentals}.

\begin{equation} \label{shock}
\frac{P_4}{P_1} = \frac{2\gamma_1M_1^2 - (\gamma_1 - 1)}{\gamma_1 + 1}\left(1 - \frac{\gamma_{4-1}}{\gamma_{1+1}}\frac{U_1}{U_4}\left(M_1 - \frac{1}{M_1}\right)\right)^{-2\gamma_4/\gamma_{4-1}}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Schlieren Imaging}
The shock-driven, transient, supersonic jet is measured using a Toepler Z-type schlieren apparatus \cite{settles2001schlieren} (illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:3}) with the Shimadzu HPV-1 camera. The Shimadzu has a resolution of 312 x 260 pixels and a frame rate of up to 1 million fps.

\subsection{Post Processing}
Schlieren imaging produces a path integrated density gradient image that is excellent for flow visualisation but, is difficult to quantitatively extract physical parameters directly from image data. 
the required second order image derivatives are computed by convolution with the second order derivatives of the Gaussian kernel (reference). Mathematically this means that if f denotes the image and G the normalised Gaussian, we compute
EQUATIONS
where * denotes spatial convolution, x=(x,y) denotes the pixel position, and the derivative directions i and j can be x or y. The eigenvectors and eigenvalues are computed in the algorithm from a standard second derivative Hessian matrix

%
%
%\subsection{Abstract}
%An abstract appears at the beginning of Full-Length Papers, Regular Articles, and Express Articles. (Survey and Design Forum Papers, History of Key Technologies Papers, invited lectures, and Technical/Engineering Notes do not include abstracts.) The abstract is one paragraph (not an introduction) and complete in itself (no reference numbers). It should indicate subjects dealt with in the paper and state the objectives of the investigation. Newly observed facts and conclusions of the experiment or argument discussed in the paper must be stated in summary form; readers should not have to read the paper to understand the abstract. Format the abstract bold, indented 3 picas (1/2 in.) on each side, and separated from the rest of the document by two blank lines.
%
%
%\subsection{Nomenclature}
%Papers with many symbols may benefit from a nomenclature list that defines all symbols with units, inserted between the abstract and the introduction. If one is used, it must contain all the symbology used in the manuscript, and the definitions should not be repeated in the text. In all cases, identify the symbols used if they are not widely recognized in the profession. Define acronyms in the text, not in the nomenclature. 
%
%\subsection{Biographies}
%Survey Papers and some Full-Length Papers include author biographies. These biographies are one paragraph each and should use the abstract formatting style.
%
%\subsection{Footnotes and References}
%Footnotes, where they appear, should be placed above the 1'' margin at the bottom of the page. To insert footnotes into the template, use the Insert>Footnote feature from the main menu as necessary. Footnotes are formatted automatically in the template, but if another medium is used, should appear in superscript as symbols in the sequence, *, $\dag$, $\ddag$, \S, \P, **, $\dag\dag$, $\ddag\ddag$, \S\S, etc.
%
%List and number all references at the end of the paper. Corresponding bracketed numbers are used to cite references in the text \cite{vatistas1986reverse}, including citations that are an integral part of the sentence (e.g., ``It is shown in \cite{dornheim1996planetary} that\ldots '') or follow a mathematical expression: ``$A^{2} + B = C$ (Ref.~\cite{terster1997nasa}).'' For multiple citations, separate reference numbers with commas \cite{peyret2012computational,oates1997aerothermodynamics}, or use a dash to show a range \cite{volpe1994techniques,thompsonspacecraft,chi1993fluid}. Reference citations in the text should be in numerical order.
%
%In the reference list, give all authors' names; do not use ``et al.'' unless there are six authors or more. Papers that have not been published should be cited as ``unpublished''; papers that have been submitted or accepted for publication should be cited as ``submitted for publication.'' Private communications and personal website should appear as footnotes rather than in the reference list.
%
%References should be cited according to the standard publication reference style (for examples, see the ``References'' section of this template). Never edit titles in references to conform to AIAA style of spellings, abbreviations, etc. Names and locations of publishers should be listed; month and year should be included for reports and papers. For papers published in translation journals, please give the English citation first, followed by the original foreign language citation.
%
%\subsection{Figures and Tables}
%Insert tables and figures within your document; they may be either scattered throughout the text or grouped all together at the end of the file. Do not insert your figures in text boxes. Figures should have no background, borders, or outlines. In the \LaTeX{} template, use the ``caption'' command to type caption text. Captions are bold with a single tab (no hyphen or other character) between the figure number and figure description. See the Table 1 example for table style and column alignment. If you wish to center tables that do not fill the width of the page, simply highlight and ‚Äúgrab‚Äù the entire table to move it into proper position.

%
%Line drawings must be clear and sharp. Make sure that all lines and graph points are dark and distinct and that lettering is legible; 8- to 10-point type is suitable for artwork that is sized to fit the column width (3 ¬º in.). Keep the lettering size and style uniform both within each figure and throughout all of your illustrations. Place figure captions below each figure, and limit caption length to 20-25 words. If your figure has multiple parts, include the labels ‚Äúa),‚Äù ‚Äúb),‚Äù etc., below and to the left of each part, above the figure caption. Please verify that the figures and tables you mention in the text actually exist. When citing a figure in the text, use the abbreviation ‚ÄúFig.‚Äù except at the beginning of a sentence. Do not abbreviate ‚ÄúTable.‚Äù Number each different type of illustration (i.e., figures and tables) sequentially with relation to other illustrations of the same type.
%
%Figure labels must be legible after reduction to column width (preferably 8--10 points after reduction).
%
%All tables are numbered consecutively and must be cited in the text; give each table a definitive title. Be sure that you have a minimum of two columns (with headings) and two rows to constitute a proper table; otherwise reformat as a displayed list or incorporate the data into the text. Plan tables to fit the column width (3 ¬º in.) or the journal page width (7 in.). Position a double rule at the top and bottom of each table and single rule under the column headings; do not use shading, border lines, or vertical rules between table columns. Position each table in the text close to where it is cited
%
%
%\subsection{Equations}
%Equations are numbered consecutively, with equation numbers in parentheses flush right, as in Eq.~\eqref{sample:equation}. Insert a blank line on either side of the equation. To insert an equation into the \LaTeX{} document, use the \verb|\begin{equation}...\end{equation}| command environment.
%
%A sample equation is included here, formatted using the preceding instructions:
%
%\begin{equation}
%\label{sample:equation}
%\int^{r_2}_0 F(r,\varphi){\rm d}r\,{\rm d}\varphi = [\sigma r_2/(2\mu_0)]\int^{\infty}_0\exp(-\lambda|z_j-z_i|)\lambda^{-1}J_1 (\lambda r_2)J_0 (\lambda r_i\,\lambda {\rm d}\lambda)
%\end{equation}
%
%Be sure that symbols in your equation are defined in the Nomenclature or immediately following the equation. Also define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the main text. (Very common abbreviations such as AIAA and NASA, do not have to be defined.)
%
%\subsection{General Grammar and Preferred Usage}
%Use only one space after periods or colons. Hyphenate complex modifiers: ``zero-field-cooled magnetization.'' Insert a zero before decimal points: ``0.25,'' not ``.25.'' Use ``\si{\centi\meter\squared}'' not ``cc.'' 
%
%A parenthetical statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within parenthesis.)
